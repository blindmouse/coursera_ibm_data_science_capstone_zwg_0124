# Week 2 Exploratory data analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

In jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb, we used sql queries to see some descriptive statistics of interest. A database called my_data1.db was created to store the data tables for quering.
In jupyter-labs-eda-datavis.ipynb, we visualized payload mass, lauch site, flight number, orbit, launch year, as well as success rate. The output is stored as dataaset_part_3.csv.
